    <p>
      I recently made some changes to the website. I decided to write about them to help others
      do something similar on their personal static websites.
    </p>
    <h2>Search bar</h2>
    <p>
      I added a search bar to the home page of victorzhou.dev. This site is indexed by
      <a href="https://searchmysite.net/">Search My Site</a>. Search My Site indexes my website
      for me, and provides an API for me to implement a search bar on my own domain. The code for
      the search bar is just in a <span class="code">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag, and can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/OiCMudkips/victorzhoudev/blob/8fefa7b0276b1885da878cbe9504dae1df0e048d/src/index.html#L36-L86">here</a>.
      Search My Site has a very helpful <a href="https://blog.searchmysite.net/posts/adding-a-simple-search-page-to-my-personal-website-with-searchmysite.net/">blog post</a> which I used to start writing this.
    </p>
    <h3>Filtering out category pages</h3>
    <p>
      I did also have to update some of the paths on my site to make the search more useful. The
      search was returning some of the category pages on my site
      (such as <span class="code">/transit/index.html</span>),
      so a search for any word in an article title would return up to 2 extra links: a link to the
      category page, and a link to the home page, if the article was linked to on the home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fixed this by taking advantage of how Apache serves <span class="code">index.html</span>
      if no file name is specified. I've updated links to category pages and the home page to
      not link to a <span class="code">index.html</span> URL. For example, the footer for this article
      might have previously looked like this
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;footer&gt;
  &lt;a href="./index.html"&gt;Programming notes&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="../index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      Now, it looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">
&lt;footer&gt;
  &lt;a href="./"&gt;Programming notes&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="../"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      This makes it so that Search My Site indexes the category pages without an <span class="code">.html</span> URL.
      The article pages are still indexed with an <span class="code">.html</span> URL. This means
      that the search can just filter for html URLs. This is done by just filtering
      out non-HTML urls in the frontend (<a href="https://github.com/OiCMudkips/victorzhoudev/blob/8fefa7b0276b1885da878cbe9504dae1df0e048d/src/index.html#L48-L50">code</a>).
      However, writing this article, I discovered that Search
      My Site will allows developers to filter URLs too, so I will update the search query
      to take advantage of this immediately. As in, it will already be live, and here is the
      <a href="https://github.com/OiCMudkips/victorzhoudev/commit/566da7445ebb84c6980d62241c7bf0d8d735f796">commit</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Testing in production</h3>
    <p>
      It was hard for me to test the search functionality locally, as Search My Site
      <a href="https://github.com/searchmysite/searchmysite.net/blob/4cc2ed15e623e00eba6a70bc28ed45768d6eb1ab/src/web/content/dynamic/searchmysite/api/searchapi.py#L102-L113">only allows</a>
      the domain being searched to access the API in a fetch request. The code seems to try
      to enable localhost testing, but it didn't work for me. Maybe I'm misinterpreting what line 105
      is trying to accomplish. As a result, while testing locally, all I could do was click the button
      and see what the blocked GET request looked like. This wasn't effective at ensuring that search
      results were rendered correctly. As a result, I had to do deploy the website and test on
      victorzhou.dev.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting up Gcore CDN</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to set up a CDN for the images on this site. Previously, images were served directly
      from S3 with an S3 url, but it felt cleaner to serve assets from a
      <span class="code">victorzhou.dev</span> URL. There are also performance advantages with a CDN,
      but these were just a bonus for me, as I don't think there is particularly high load to this
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't want to use an Amazon CDN or Cloudflare for personal reasons. I just searched
      for free CDNs and I ended up on Gcore. I liked that they were based in the EU, and were
      therefore subject to probably-better privacy laws than other jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The setup turned out to be really straight-forward. This is the
      <a href="https://gcore.com/support/articles/213969429/">guide</a> I used.
      You just set up a CDN resource in Gcore, point it to your S3 bucket, and set up a CNAME record.
      It even sets up https on the CDN subdomain you configure automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did take some time for the CNAME records to propogate so that the Let's Encrypt certificate
      could be created. The UI does warn you about this, but I saw a number of different error messages
      during the process, so I got confused and restarted the certificate generation in the UI
      a couple of times. It was pretty low effort to click "cancel" then "generate" though,
      so no big deal. I could have avoided this "problem" by just waiting for the DNS to propogate
      properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what the pageload waterfall for my homepage looks like with Gcore CDN serving the
      image assets. It looks fine to me. I did probably warm up the CDN by trying to get this
      waterfall screenshot. For reference, I am located in Seattle, USA with fiber internet.
