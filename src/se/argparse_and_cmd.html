    <p>
      I'm currently creating an interactive tool in Python to do CRUD things.
      This article focuses on how I'm using two Python standard libraries,
      <a class="code" href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/argparse.html">argparse</a>
      and <a class="code" href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/cmd.html">cmd</a>, to
      enable user interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a very simple <span class="code">cmd</span>-based tool that does two things: create and
      delete servers, along with some sample output from running the tool.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/a5e8b9a2b3e99bc2f15ec88c8b816b50.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/35c68f72209a77de1ce47a72fc00c23f.js"></script>
    <p>
      The important thing to note here is that <span class="code">arg</span> is a single string
      containing all the text after the name of the command. This means that if we want to pass
      more than one argument to this tool, we'll need to split <span class="code">arg</span>
      manually. This differs from <span class="code">sys.argv</span>, which is
      already a list of strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's try to modify <span class="code">1.py</span> to handle an additional argument
      in the <span class="code">do_create</span> function.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/289803950674d3f152e9ead3318e45aa.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/629c43330f1c81176321850aa8377568.js"></script>
    <p>
      Great, we can now interpret two arguments. However, if we were to add more arguments, the user
      would need to remember the order of arguments, and it would be clumsy to unpack an array into a
      large number of individual local variables. Additionally, this method of parsing arguments
      doesn't support optional arguments cleanly. These are problems that the standard library
      <span class="code">argparse</span> has solutions for. We can use
      <span class="code">argparse.ArgumentParser</span> to scale the number of arguments in a
      maintainable way, and support optional arguments at the same time.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/6f527f69f7d1fa3a59c4d31bb8cb4559.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/12f73fb23ed8003784f6dc4db09a4b70.js"></script>
    <p>
      At this point, you might be tempted to think that we're done, and that we can just use all
      the features of <span class="code">argparse</span> to solve all our argument-parsing problems.
      However, there are some issues with the above implementation. The first problem is that this
      solution doesn't currently support spaces in arguments.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/4710036dce66d8c07b3d52d8ff05fcee.js"></script>
    <p>
      Can fix this by wrapping <span class="code">my server</span>
      between quotations, or by escaping the space with a backslach (<span class="code">\ </span>)?
      No, because these are shell constructs. We are already inside a Python program, so the usual
      space-escaping rules do not work in our program.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way this can be fixed is to replicate the space-escaping behaviour that shells provide. I
      chose not to do this because I didn't want to implement a shell feature in my CRUD. Instead, I
      chose to specify <span class="code">nargs='+'</span> for any optional string arguments. By
      default, <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span> parses such argument into a list of strings.
      However, I just want one string as the argument (remember, we're parsing a name field). I chose
      to accomplish this by implementing a custom
      <a class="code" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Action">Action</a>.
      Once we tell our <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span> to use this custom
      <span class="code">Action</span>, we get the desired result: an argument with spaces in it.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/a27c554948464b09027a4fd684071ebf.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/cc2d81ad450fdacf6a5e95db98e27a85.js"></script>
    <p>
      There's another issue in <span class="code">3_output_2</span>. Notice how the program exits to shell
      after <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span> fails to parse the unknown argument.
      <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span> does this by calling
      <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/59f5022b5d3e5fcc60ac61cc256b627decf8ee68/Lib/argparse.py#L2576" class="code">sys.exit()</a>.
      This makes sense for a program launched from a shell, but exiting to the shell doesn't make sense
      in our interactive tool. We want for the user to be able to run other commands within the
      <span class="code">cmd</span> loop after an error.
      <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0389/#discussion-sys-stderr-and-sys-exit">PEP 389</a>
      addresses this, and says we should subclass <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span> and override
      the <span class="code">error</span> method (1). Let's go ahead and do that.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/620bf47c3b4376219aa49a21dc77abab.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/6f485b03ef1d27b5fdd5c1ad4260e084.js"></script>
    <p>
      The user now sees a helpful error message when they input command arguments incorrectly. The
      parameter description (<span class="code">NAME [NAME ...]</span>) looks a bit weird, but this is
      the tradeoff for not having to re-implement space-escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another neat feature of <span class="code">cmd</span> is that <span class="code">cmd</span>
      programs have a default command called <span class="code">help</span>, which displays help text
      for commands within the program. We can use the argument parser that we wrote for each function
      to display this help text. Let's extract the parser creation out to a function and use the parser
      in the <span class="code">help</span> method.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/d847deb1c6438faa9b61aaaab5d0ecf5.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/97c2196414d7a4e253c512451b692f12.js"></script>
    <p>
      If you're familiar with <span class="code">argparse</span> you might be wondering why I bothered
      to write this code just to print some help text. By default, all
      <span class="code">ArgumentParser</span>s have a default option <span class="code">--help</span>
      which prints the same text without needing to call <span class="code">print_help</span> manually.
      Let's see what happens if we try to use invoke <span class="code">create</span> with the
      <span class="code">--help</span> option.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/0ead26d6f4c3af6755d9b4b1e3aa1d86.js"></script>
    <p>
      Using <span class="code">--help</span> exits the program; this should seem familiar. Indeed,
      the <span class="code">--help</span> flag also results in a
      <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/59f5022b5d3e5fcc60ac61cc256b627decf8ee68/Lib/argparse.py#L1092-L1094" class="code">sys.exit()</a>!
      We'll need to implement our own <span class="code">--help</span> if we want to
      prevent the program from exiting. To prevent the body of our program from having to deal
      with argument parsing and handling, let's implement a custom <span class="code">Action</span>
      again. This new <span class="code">Action</span> will mimic the behaviour of the existing help
      flag, but only raise an exception, not terminate the whole program.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/6f3854d55ef3cc9df551b537901e5723.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/OiCMudkips/8ab74615115a6a2f3a60101a3e093717.js"></script>
    <p>
      And with that, we have implemented a <span class="code">cmd</span>-based interpreter that
      interprets user input using the <span class="code">argparse</span> library. If I discover any
      other weird results of using <span class="code">argparse</span> within a cmd-based interpreter,
      I will be sure to make a followup post.

        (1) I'm kind of curious if "if this turns out to be a common need." has turned out to be true.
        Maybe I'll write a followup post on this topic.
