    <p>
      The time is currently 7:55 AM. I am seated in Economy on the Clipper ferry from Seattle,
      Washington to Victoria, British Columbia. I wanted to charge my phone and get some sleep
      on the ferry, as I stayed up all night to make sure I would make it to this ferry on time.
      Unforunately, there is no power so I cannot charge my phone which is currently at 61% charge.
      The seat is also probably not one that I can get a good nap in, as the back is not tall enough.
      So, to try to occupy my time, I'm keeping this journal of thoughts.
    </p>
    <h3>Boarding to Victoria</h3>
    <p>
      I arrived at the ferry terminal at about 7:10 AM, where I found a twenty minute line to check
      in. I didn't feel too cold since I decided to wear a heavier jacket. Check in was pretty easy;
      I handed my passport over and I received a boarding pass printed on orange paper.
      I sat in the boarding area for about five minutes before my row was called for boarding;
      boarding had already started at around 7:15 AM.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lined up to board and a staff member scanned by boarding pass' QR code, with no ID check
      required. My seat was pretty much right at the entrance, so I was able to get seated pretty
      quickly. It's Thanksgiving today so there are a lot of tourists headed to Victoria for the
      day or weekend so the ferry was pretty full, but somehow, I was able to get a group of seats
      all to myself!
    </p>
    <h2><time datetime="2022-11-24">November 24, 2022 9:00 PM</time></h2>
    <p>
      It is now 9:00 PM and I'm in the Ocean Island Inn. It turns out that I was in fact able
      to nap during the ferry ride, so the above it pretty much all I got to write.  
    </p>
    <h3>Onboard Experience to Victoria</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing the crew does when the ship leaves is give a safety briefing. After that,
      the galleys open for service; I was hungry so I lined up for some food. There's not really any
      good space to line up so you end up just lining up into the aisle between seats, which
      I guess would be awkward for the people sitting near the aisle. I think this was only a problem
      right at the start of the ride though.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting in line, the ship suddenly slowed down and honked a couple times. A crewmember
      came on the PA to tell us that we slowed down because of a whale sighting! I was able to see
      the tail of the whale, but no more. A bunch of people got up from their seats on the other
      side of the ship to come to the side where the whales were spotted, but I don't think we
      saw any more whales.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a ten minute wait, I got to the front of the line. I ordered a banana loaf
      (sourced from Alki Bakery) and a decaf coffee (from their espresso machine). I tried to tip to
      the nearest dollar, but I couldn't figure out how to tip only seventy-three cents instead of
      seventy-three dollays so I gave up and gave no tip. Sorry galley employee!
    </p>
    <p>
      I brought my food to my seat, ate the banana loaf, drank half of the decaf, and then I fell
      asleep. I woke up when we were about thirty minutes away from Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final note about the ferry, for some reason I expected power outlets to be available
      to charge my phone, but there weren't. There was a USB hub located near the galley that
      passengers might have been able to use for phone charging, but the location wasn't particular
      secure and it would have been awkward to stand around there, so I didn't use it.
    </p>
    <h3>Offboarding Experience</h3>
    <p>
      The crew seperate the passengers into two groups for offboarding: those without checked baggage
      and those with checked baggage. Passengers without checked baggage offboard since they can
      get inspected by CBSA first. Those with checked baggage are allowed to offboard once the
      FRS Clipper staff get all the checked baggage ready for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned, since my seat was at the entrance, I was able to get off pretty quickly. I cleared
      immigration and customs pretty quickly, and was able to start my trip.
    </p>
    <h2><time datetime="2022-11-25">November 25, 2022 6:00 PM</time></h2>
    <p>
      Well, this is an unexpected sequel. I was supposed to fly back to Seatle by seaplane, but
      I guess the cloud cover was too low either in Seattle or Victoria to operate the seaplane
      safely, so the operator cancelled the flight. I'm glad they gave sufficient notice, as I was
      able to cancel my flight, get a refund, and then book the Victoria Clipper back to Seattle.
    </p>
    <h3>Boarding to Seattle</h3>
    <p>
      I arrived at the terminal fairly early since I had nothing to do; I was supposed to already
      have left Victoria and had nothing else planned to do. Unlike in Seattle, the staff didn't
      check my passport; they just asked me for my name and handed me a boarding pass. I guess they
      don't need to check passports since CBP immigration is done in the Victoria ferry terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point, one of the staff members went outside and instructed incoming passengers
      to wait outside unless they had baggage to check. They probably do this to control crowding
      in the terminal, because I don't think everyone could have fit inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 3:45 PM, the CBP checkpoint opened. I ended up near the end of the line of whose who were
      seated inside the terminal. I stood in line for 20 minutes before I got to an officer and
      cleared customs.
    </p>
    <h2>Onboard Experience to Seattle</h2>
    <p>
      Once past CBP, there is a boarding area with a bunch of seats. The seats weren't really needed
      since they were already boarding all seating groups. I guess with a slow trickle of
      people, you don't really need boarding groups. Since I booked the Clipper with short notice,
      they had no more Economy seats so I had to pay extra for a Vista seat. I guess the Vista
      seat does have more legroom than Economy seats, but I can't say that I would have chosen Vista
      for this trip since the sun was set for most of the journey, hiding any vista that we would
      have enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent most of the time in the terminal and on the ferry playing Sudoku on sudoku.com and
      listening to Rent. My phone died at around 6:00 PM, so I pulled out my laptop and started
      writing this sequel.
