      I became aware of Series I bonds back in <time datetime="2022-04">April 2022</time>
      (specifically their high interest rates), and tried to open a TreasuryDirect account to
      purchase some. Unfortunately I was unable to convince the treasury that I am me online, so I
      had to complete a FS Form 5444 to verify that my account was actually being opened by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back then, the form stipulated that only financial institutions could validate the
      form. I did some research at the time (I Googled it), and it seemed like it was really hard
      to get this validation from major financial instituations. So, I just gave up at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later in <time datetime="2022-07">July 2022</time>, I looked into opening a
      TreasuryDirect account again. I found a
      <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=376554">post on an investing forum</a>
      that claimed that the Treasury was now accepting notary certifications. I checked FS Form
      FS5444 again, and the form had been updated to a <time datetime="2022-06">June 2022</time>
      revision. The form still required a bank validation, so I had some doubts about the forum post
      from a random stranger, but I went ahead and got the form notarized and mailed it to the
      Treasury [1]. Yesterday, I checked the TreasuryDirect website again and my account was unlocked;
      hurray!
    </p>
    <p>
      While writing this article, I checked again and the form has been revised as of
      <time datetime="2022-08">August 2022</time>. The form finally officially clarifies that
      notaries can certify the form, so it should be easier for everyone to be able to open a
      TreasuryDirect bond.

        [1] Fun fact, I got overcharged to get my form notarized.
        <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=308-30-220">Washington law</a>
        says that the maximum fee for witnessing a signature is $10.00, but I got charged $15.00.
        I'll complain to Washington state eventually. Maybe.
