      I had an engineering org all-hands meeting for which I could expense a meal.
      I wanted some Cantonese food but there are no such restaurants within walking distance,
      so I ordered my meal via DoorDash. The food came and it was great; now, I need to get
      reimbursed by my company. Let me just pull up the receipt from the DoorDash app...
    </p>
    <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
    <img
      src="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/victorzhoudev.media/img/doordash_receipts/Image+from+iOS.png"
      alt="DoorDash receipt showing the date as &quot;Today at 12:08 PM&quot;"
      style="max-height: 40em;"
      loading="lazy" />
    </div>
    <p>
      The problem here is that the date on this receipt is shown as "Today at 12:08 PM."
      This is not a date that is acceptable to the IRS for a reimbursement, so my company will not
      reimburse me for my meal using this receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      My solution has been to wait until the next day to generate a receipt. This way, Doordash's
      receipt template recognizes that the day has passed and doesn't change "2022/05/24" to "Today".
    </p>
    <p>
      I would love if DoorDash didn't use this human-friendly date formatting in a document that
      some may use in a legal reimbursement context.
