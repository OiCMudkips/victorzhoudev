        I visited Buntzen Lake in the British Columbia Lower Mainland in <time datetime="2023-11">November 2023</time>.
        Here are some of the photos I took. (Clicking on a picture will open the photo in your browser.)

      <p>I really liked the reflection of the sun behind the two guys on the pier. It was very sunny that day, and the contrast highlights that.</p>

      <p>A bird. I wished I brought my telephoto lens out more often.</p>

      <p>The bird would really look out-of-the-world if it wasn't for the shadow.</p>
