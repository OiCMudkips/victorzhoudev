      I travelled to Japan in <time datetime="2023-06">June 2023</time> with some friends. We
      all arrived to, and departed from, Japan on different days and flights. As a result, I
      had a couple of days to myself. I decided to spend the majority of my time on Sado Island
      (<span lang="jp">佐渡島</span>). This blog entry details my time spent on the island.
    </p>
    <h2>Day 1: Walking up to the Donden Highland Lodge</h2>
    <p>I started day 1 in a hostel in Osaka. My goal for that day was to make it to my lodgings,
      the Donden Highland Lodge on top of Sado Island, a fairly ambitious goal.
    </p>

      I left my hostel at around 6:30 AM to head to Osaka Itami Airport for my flight to Niigata. I
      thought I was in for a long train ride from Nishinari Ward, but thanks to the power of Google
      Maps, I was able to find and ride a convenient airport bus from Doubutsuen-mae Station. At the
      airport, I got some mackerel with rice for breakfast.

      The flight to Niigata was pretty uneventful, and we landed at around 9:40 AM. At Niigata
      Airport, I had to get to the jetfoil ferry terminal to Sado Island. I thought that I would
      have to take a bus to Niigata Station, then transfer to a local bus to the ferry terminal,
      but through some last-minute research, I found out there was a shuttle straight to the
      ferry terminal. Here is the information for that shuttle for 2023:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.niigata-airport.gr.jp/access/liner/sado/?&lang=en">English</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As of writing, the English site has an incorrect adult fare listed.
          The fare is actually 700 yen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://s-kuko2000.com/topics/818/">Japanese</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you choose to take this shuttle, make sure to bring some exact change. I think the
      driver might be able to provide a small amount of change, but it didn't look like he had
      a lot of coins.

      I was the only passenger headed to the ferry terminal that morning. The driver asked me
      if I was hiking (I was!) and talked about the time he had spent on Sado Island when he was
      younger. I didn't understand a bunch of it, but it was pretty cute! We got to the ferry
      terminal on time, and I got a gyuudon at the cafeteria there.
